Like many aspiring developers, I built this site to showcase my previous work and let you know a little bit more about me. It's definitely overkill to build this in React, since it's mostly a static site. However, this sets me up well for when I eventually add a blog.

## Portfolio Website

### Uses:

* React
* JavaScript
* SASS
* Node.js
* Express

## Features:

* Uses Node.js, Express, and NodeMailer for Contact form
* Works in Chrome, Edge, IE, and mobile
* Hosted on an AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu and Apache
* 100s on all Lighthouse Audits:
