            I've been a hobby developer since the GeoCities and Angelfire days, back when "the internet" came on a CD, web pages were ugly, 
            and half the text blinked or scrolled. Iâ€™ve built my own PC twice, ran Ubuntu as my main OS for ~2 years 
            just for fun, flashed custom firmware to my router, wired my whole house up with Cat6, and have automated just about anything 
            I can think of with <a href="http://www.eventghost.net/" alt="EventGhost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EventGhost (Windows) </a> 
            and <a href="https://tasker.joaoapps.com/" alt="Tasker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tasker (Android)</a>.

            Despite always being interested in technology, I earned a BA and MBA in Marketing and spent my first six years of employment
            as a marketing manager. Over the last few years, I've ramped up my hobby development projects and self-study and am fully committed
            to switching my career into software and web development. That's where my true passion lies.

            Call me a masochist, but I really, truly enjoy banging my head against a wall trying to solve a problem just to get that 
            tiny little rush of endorphins once I figure it out and make things work.
