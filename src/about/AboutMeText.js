        <p>I've been a hobby developer since the GeoCities and Angelfire days, back when the internet was ugly, 
            text blinked and scrolled, and you hoped and prayed your visitors signed your guestbook.
        </p>
        <p>Although most of my professional career has been in marketing, I'm now transitioning to pursue my true 
            passion of software and web development. My marketing experience brings unique 
            and valuable insight to the development process.
        </p>
        <p>I'm passionate about designing and programming amazing software and web applications. Every pixel matters and every 
            edge case is important.
